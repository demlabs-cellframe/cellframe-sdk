  CRC32C_ADLER -- Computes CRC32C Checksums
  Version 1.2, Date 05/21/18
  Copyright (C) 2013 Mark Adler <madler@alumni.caltech.edu>
  Copyright (C) 2018 Fonic <https://github.com/fonic>

  Provides both a hardware-accelerated algorithm (*) and a software algorithm.
  Note that this computes CRC32C checksums, not CRC32 (without 'C') checksums
  used by Ethernet, gzip, etc.

  (*) CRC instruction on Intel SSE 4.2 processors.  SSE 4.2 was first supported
      by Nehalem processors introduced in November, 2008.

  Version history:
  1.0  10 Feb 2013  First version
  1.1   1 Aug 2013  Correct comments on why three crc instructions in parallel
  1.2  21 May 2018  Add header file, revise hardware support check, eliminate
                    pthreads, restructure code, revise comments and description
