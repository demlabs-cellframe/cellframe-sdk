## v0.11.7 at 2022-04-22

The stable risen release after the Github's intentional malicious disaster.

#### We have migrated to a reliable trusted infrastructure
The origin for now is at [GitFlic](https://gitflic.ru/project/erthink/libmdbx)
since on 2022-04-15 the Github administration, without any warning nor
explanation, deleted _libmdbx_ along with a lot of other projects,
simultaneously blocking access for many developers.
For the same reason ~~Github~~ is blacklisted forever.

GitFlic already support Russian and English languages, plan to support more,
including 和 中文. You are welcome!

New:

 - Added the `tools-static` make target to build statically linked MDBX tools.
 - Support for Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
 - Support build by MinGW' make from command line without CMake.
 - Added `mdbx::filesystem` C++ API namespace that corresponds to `std::filesystem` or `std::experimental::filesystem`.
 - Created [website](https://libmdbx.website.yandexcloud.net/) for online auto-generated documentation.
 - Used `todo4recovery://erased_by_github/` for dead (or temporarily lost) resources deleted by ~~Github~~.
 - Added `--loglevel=` command-line option to the `mdbx_test` tool.
 - Added few fast smoke-like tests into CMake builds.

Fixes:

 - Fixed a race between starting a transaction and creating a DBI descriptor that could lead to `SIGSEGV` in the cursor tracking code.
 - Clarified description of `MDBX_EPERM` error returned from `mdbx_env_set_geometry()`.
 - Fixed non-promoting the parent transaction to be dirty in case the undo of the geometry update failed during abortion of a nested transaction.
 - Resolved linking issues with `libstdc++fs`/`libc++fs`/`libc++experimental` for C++ `std::filesystem` or `std::experimental::filesystem` for legacy compilers.
 - Added workaround for GNU Make 3.81 and earlier.
 - Added workaround for Elbrus/LCC 1.25 compiler bug of class inline `static constexpr` member field.
 - [Fixed](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/issues/3874) minor assertion regression (only debug builds were affected).
 - Fixed detection of `C++20` concepts accessibility.
 - Fixed detection of Clang's LTO availability for Android.
 - Fixed build for ARM/ARM64 by MSVC.
 - Fixed non-x86 Windows builds with `MDBX_WITHOUT_MSVC_CRT=ON` and `MDBX_BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY=ON`.

Minors:

 - Resolve minor MSVC warnings: avoid `/INCREMENTAL[:YES]` with `/LTCG`, `/W4` with `/W3`, the `C5105` warning.
 - Switched to using `MDBX_EPERM` instead of `MDBX_RESULT_TRUE' to indicate that the geometry cannot be updated.
 - Added `NULL` checking during memory allocation inside `mdbx_chk`.
 - Resolved all warnings from MinGW while used without CMake.
 - Added inheretable `target_include_directories()` to `CMakeLists.txt` for easy integration.
 - Added build-time checks and paranoid runtime assertions for the `off_t` arguments of `fcntl()` which are used for locking.
 - Added `-Wno-lto-type-mismatch` to avoid false-positive warnings from old GCC during LTO-enabled builds.
 - Added checking for TID (system thread id) to avoid hang on 32-bit Bionic/Android  within `pthread_mutex_lock()`.
 - Reworked `MDBX_BUILD_TARGET` of CMake builds.
 - Added `CMAKE_HOST_ARCH` and `CMAKE_HOST_CAN_RUN_EXECUTABLES_BUILT_FOR_TARGET`.

## v0.11.1 at 2021-10-23

### Backward compatibility break:

The database format signature has been changed to prevent
forward-interoperability with an previous releases, which may lead to a
[false positive diagnosis of database corruption](todo4recovery://erased_by_github/libmdbx/issues/238)
due to flaws of an old library versions.

This change is mostly invisible:

 - previously versions are unable to read/write a new DBs;
 - but the new release is able to handle an old DBs and will silently upgrade ones.

Acknowledgements:

 - [Alex Sharov](https://github.com/AskAlexSharov) for reporting and testing.


## v0.10.5 at 2021-10-13 (obsolete, please use v0.11.1)

Unfortunately, the `v0.10.5` accidentally comes not full-compatible with previous releases:

 - `v0.10.5` can read/processing DBs created by previous releases, i.e. the backward-compatibility is provided;
 - however, previous releases may lead to false-corrupted state with DB that was touched by `v0.10.5`, i.e. the forward-compatibility is broken for `v0.10.4` and earlier.

This cannot be fixed, as it requires fixing past versions, which as a result we will just get a current version.
Therefore, it is recommended to use `v0.11.1` instead of `v0.10.5`.

Acknowledgements:

 - [Noel Kuntze](https://github.com/Thermi) for immediately bug reporting.

Fixes:

 - Fixed unaligned access regression after the `#pragma pack` fix for modern compilers.
 - Added UBSAN-test to CI to avoid a regression(s) similar to lately fixed.
 - Fixed possibility of meta-pages clashing after manually turn to a particular meta-page using `mdbx_chk` utility.

Minors:

 - Refined handling of weak or invalid meta-pages while a DB opening.
 - Refined providing information for the `@MAIN` and `@GC` sub-databases of a last committed modification transaction's ID.


## v0.10.4 at 2021-10-10

Acknowledgements:

 - [Artem Vorotnikov](https://github.com/vorot93) for support [Rust wrapper](https://github.com/vorot93/libmdbx-rs).
 - [Andrew Ashikhmin](https://github.com/yperbasis) for contributing to C++ API.

Fixes:

 - Fixed possibility of looping update GC during transaction commit (no public issue since the problem was discovered inside [Positive Technologies](https://www.ptsecurity.ru)).
 - Fixed `#pragma pack` to avoid provoking some compilers to generate code with [unaligned access](todo4recovery://erased_by_github/libmdbx/issues/235).
 - Fixed `noexcept` for potentially throwing `txn::put()` of C++ API.

Minors:

 - Added stochastic test script for checking small transactions cases.
 - Removed extra transaction commit/restart inside test framework.
 - In debugging builds fixed a too small (single page) by default DB shrink threshold.

 - Added more workarounds for QEMU for testing builds for 32-bit platforms, Alpha and Sparc architectures.
 - `mdbx_chk` now skips iteration & checking of DB' records if corresponding page-tree is corrupted (to avoid `SIGSEGV`, ASAN failures, etc).
 - Added more checks for [rare/fuzzing corruption cases](todo4recovery://erased_by_github/libmdbx/issues/217).

Backward compatibility break:

 - Use file `VERSION.txt` for version information instead of `VERSION` to avoid collision with `#include <version>`.
 - Rename `slice::from/to_FOO_bytes()` to `slice::envisage_from/to_FOO_length()'.
 - Rename `MDBX_TEST_EXTRA` make's variable to `MDBX_SMOKE_EXTRA`.
 - Some details of the C++ API have been changed for subsequent freezing.

Fixes:

 - Fixed excess meta-pages checks in case `mdbx_chk` is called to check the DB for a specific meta page and thus could prevent switching to the selected meta page, even if the check passed without errors.

## v0.10.0 at 2021-05-09

Acknowledgements:

 - [Mahlon E. Smith](https://github.com/mahlonsmith) for [Ruby bindings](https://rubygems.org/gems/mdbx/).
 - [Alex Sharov](https://github.com/AskAlexSharov) for [mdbx-go](https://github.com/torquem-ch/mdbx-go), bug reporting and testing.
 - [Artem Vorotnikov](https://github.com/vorot93) for bug reporting and PR.
 - [Paolo Rebuffo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-rebuffo-8255766/), [Alexey Akhunov](https://github.com/AlexeyAkhunov) and Mark Grosberg for donations.
 - [Noel Kuntze](https://github.com/Thermi) for preliminary [Python bindings](https://github.com/Thermi/libmdbx/tree/python-bindings)

New features:

 - Added `mdbx_env_set_option()` and `mdbx_env_get_option()` for controls
   various runtime options for an environment (announce of this feature  was missed in a previous news).
 - Added `MDBX_DISABLE_PAGECHECKS` build option to disable some checks to reduce an overhead
   and detection probability of database corruption to a values closer to the LMDB.
   The `MDBX_DISABLE_PAGECHECKS=1` provides a performance boost of about 10% in CRUD scenarios,
   and conjointly with the `MDBX_ENV_CHECKPID=0` and `MDBX_TXN_CHECKOWNER=0` options can yield
   up to 30% more performance compared to LMDB.
 - Using float point (exponential quantized) representation for internal 16-bit values
   of grow step and shrink threshold when huge ones (todo4recovery://erased_by_github/libmdbx/issues/166).
   To minimize the impact on compatibility, only the odd values inside the upper half
   of the range (i.e. 32769..65533) are used for the new representation.
 - Added the `mdbx_drop` similar to LMDB command-line tool to purge or delete (sub)database(s).
 - [Ruby bindings](https://rubygems.org/gems/mdbx/) is available now by [Mahlon E. Smith](https://github.com/mahlonsmith).
 - Added `MDBX_ENABLE_MADVISE` build option which controls the use of POSIX `madvise()` hints and friends.
 - The internal node sizes were refined, resulting in a reduction in large/overflow pages in some use cases
   and a slight increase in limits for a keys size to ≈½ of page size.
 - Added to `mdbx_chk` output number of keys/items on pages.
 - Added explicit `install-strip` and `install-no-strip` targets to the `Makefile` (todo4recovery://erased_by_github/libmdbx/pull/180).
 - Major rework page splitting (af9b7b560505684249b76730997f9e00614b8113) for
     - An "auto-appending" feature upon insertion for both ascending and
       descending key sequences. As a result, the optimality of page filling
       increases significantly (more densely, less slackness) while
       inserting ordered sequences of keys,
     - A "splitting at middle" to make page tree more balanced on average.
 - Added `mdbx_get_sysraminfo()` to the API.
 - Added guessing a reasonable maximum DB size for the default upper limit of geometry (todo4recovery://erased_by_github/libmdbx/issues/183).
 - Major rework internal labeling of a dirty pages (958fd5b9479f52f2124ab7e83c6b18b04b0e7dda) for
   a "transparent spilling" feature with the gist to make a dirty pages
   be ready to spilling (writing to a disk) without further altering ones.
   Thus in the `MDBX_WRITEMAP` mode the OS kernel able to oust dirty pages
   to DB file without further penalty during transaction commit.
   As a result, page swapping and I/O could be significantly reduced during extra large transactions and/or lack of memory.
 - Minimized reading leaf-pages during dropping subDB(s) and nested trees.
 - Major rework a spilling of dirty pages to support [LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU))
   policy and prioritization for a large/overflow pages.
 - Statistics of page operations (split, merge, copy, spill, etc) now available through `mdbx_env_info_ex()`.
 - Auto-setup limit for length of dirty pages list (`MDBX_opt_txn_dp_limit` option).
 - Support `make options` to list available build options.
 - Support `make help` to list available make targets.
 - Silently `make`'s build by default.
 - Preliminary [Python bindings](https://github.com/Thermi/libmdbx/tree/python-bindings) is available now
   by [Noel Kuntze](https://github.com/Thermi) (todo4recovery://erased_by_github/libmdbx/issues/147).

Backward compatibility break:

 - The `MDBX_AVOID_CRT` build option was renamed to `MDBX_WITHOUT_MSVC_CRT`.
   This option is only relevant when building for Windows.
 - The `mdbx_env_stat()` always, and `mdbx_env_stat_ex()` when called with the zeroed transaction parameter,
   now internally start temporary read transaction and thus may returns `MDBX_BAD_RSLOT` error.
   So, just never use deprecated `mdbx_env_stat()' and call `mdbx_env_stat_ex()` with transaction parameter.
 - The build option `MDBX_CONFIG_MANUAL_TLS_CALLBACK` was removed and now just a non-zero value of
   the `MDBX_MANUAL_MODULE_HANDLER` macro indicates the requirement to manually call `mdbx_module_handler()`
   when loading libraries and applications uses statically linked libmdbx on an obsolete Windows versions.
