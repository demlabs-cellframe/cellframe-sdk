### We have migrated to a reliable trusted infrastructure

The origin for now is at
[GitFlic](https://gitflic.ru/project/erthink/libmdbx) since on
2022-04-15 the Github administration, without any warning nor
explanation, deleted _libmdbx_ along with a lot of other projects,
simultaneously blocking access for many developers. For the same reason
~~Github~~ is blacklisted forever.

> Questions, feedback and suggestions are welcome to the [Telegram' group](https://t.me/libmdbx).

_The Future will (be) [Positive](https://www.ptsecurity.com). Всё будет хорошо._
