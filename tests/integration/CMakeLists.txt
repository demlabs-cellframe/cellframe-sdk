# Integration Tests for Cellframe SDK

# Integration tests for UTXO blocking mechanism will be implemented
# after completion of unit tests and basic infrastructure validation.
#
# Planned integration tests:
# 1. Full token lifecycle with UTXO blocking
# 2. Transaction validation with blocked UTXOs
# 3. Token update via TSD sections
# 4. Concurrent access and thread safety
# 5. Performance tests with large blocklists
#
# These tests require full ledger initialization and real blockchain environment.
